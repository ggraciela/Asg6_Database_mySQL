  <p>More about this place: Formerly the tallest freestanding structure on Earth, CN Tower stands at 1,815 feet. Brave the vertigo-inducing glass floor and the installation of extra entertainment features, such as the EdgeWalk, which dares people to walk along the abyss on a five-foot wide span atop the towerâ€™s main observation deck, 116 storeys above the ground.</p>
